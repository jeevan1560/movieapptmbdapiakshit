## ⚠️ Note on `movie.dart` and `movie.g.dart`

The files `movie.dart` and `movie.g.dart` are present in this project but are **not currently functional**.

These files were initially created for use with the **Hive database** to enable local storage of movie data. However, **Hive integration has not been implemented** in this project yet.

You can safely ignore these files for now. They are placeholders for future enhancements involving local data caching using Hive.
